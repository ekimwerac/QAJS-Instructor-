Certainly! Hereâ€™s an updated `index.js` file organized with comments for each concept, similar to the previous arrangement, along with a narrative guide for walking through the demonstration. This setup will make it easy to uncomment code blocks to demonstrate each feature as you go through each part of the form handling journey.

### `index.js`

This JavaScript file is organized with clear sections, each one labeled for demonstration purposes.

```javascript
/*
Form Validation and Handling Demonstration
-------------------------------------------
This script covers the following key concepts:
1. Field Validation with Focus, Blur, and Change Events
2. Radio Button Selection Logging
3. Form Submission with Validation
*/

// Selecting form elements
const form = document.getElementById("demoForm");
const usernameInput = document.getElementById("username");
const passwordInput = document.getElementById("password");
const commentTextarea = document.getElementById("comments");
const titleSelect = document.getElementById("title");

/*
Field Validation Events: Focus, Blur, and Change
------------------------------------------------
Demonstrates how to use focus, blur, and change events for individual fields.
*/

// Focus and Blur Events for Username Input
usernameInput.addEventListener("focus", function() {
    console.log("Username field is focused.");
});

usernameInput.addEventListener("blur", function() {
    console.log("Username field lost focus.");
});

// Change Event for Username Input
usernameInput.addEventListener("change", function() {
    console.log("Username field value changed:", usernameInput.value);
});

/*
Radio Button Selection Logging
-------------------------------
Attaches change event listeners to each radio button in the card type group
to log the selected value whenever it changes.
*/

// Function to log selected radio button value
function checkSelection(event) {
    const selectedValue = event.target.value;
    console.log("Selected card type:", selectedValue);
}

// Adding change event listeners to radio buttons
let cardtypeRadios = document.querySelectorAll('input[name="cardtype"]');
for (let i = 0; i < cardtypeRadios.length; i++) {
    cardtypeRadios[i].addEventListener("change", checkSelection);
}

/*
Form Submission with Validation
--------------------------------
Demonstrates form submission event with validation.
Prevents actual submission and logs form data instead.
*/

form.addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();  // Prevent form from submitting to avoid 405 error

    const username = usernameInput.value.trim();
    const password = passwordInput.value.trim();
    const comments = commentTextarea.value.trim();
    const title = titleSelect.value;
    const selectedCardType = Array.from(cardtypeRadios).find(radio => radio.checked)?.value || "None";

    // Validation
    if (username === "" || password === "") {
        alert("Username and password are required!");
        return;
    }

    // Log the form data
    console.log("Form Data:");
    console.log("Username:", username);
    console.log("Password:", password);  // Note: Avoid logging passwords in real applications
    console.log("Comments:", comments);
    console.log("Title:", title);
    console.log("Selected Card Type:", selectedCardType);

    document.getElementById("output").innerText = `Form Submitted!
    Username: ${username}
    Title: ${title}
    Selected Card Type: ${selectedCardType}
    Comments: ${comments}`;
});
```

### Demonstration Walkthrough

This guide provides a logical flow for demonstrating each feature, from basic field events to form submission and validation.

---

#### 1. Field Validation Events: Focus, Blur, and Change

- **Goal**: To demonstrate how the `focus`, `blur`, and `change` events work for individual form fields.
- **Instructions**:
  - **Focus Event**: Click on the "Username" input field and observe the console output. You should see `"Username field is focused."`, indicating that the field has gained focus.
  - **Blur Event**: Click away from the "Username" field (e.g., by clicking into another field) and observe the console. You should see `"Username field lost focus."`, showing that the field lost focus.
  - **Change Event**: Type a new value in the "Username" field, then click away. You should see `"Username field value changed:"` followed by the new value in the console, which logs the change event after the user finishes editing.

---

#### 2. Radio Button Selection Logging

- **Goal**: To demonstrate how to handle radio button selections using the `change` event.
- **Instructions**:
  - **Radio Button Selection**: Select any of the radio buttons under "Card Type" (e.g., Visa, MasterCard, etc.).
  - **Expected Output**: Each time you select a different option, you should see `"Selected card type:"` followed by the selected card type in the console.
  - **Explanation**: This part of the code attaches a `change` event listener to each radio button in the `cardtype` group. When a radio button is selected, the event triggers `checkSelection`, which logs the selected value.

---

#### 3. Form Submission with Validation

- **Goal**: To demonstrate form submission with validation. Prevents actual submission, logs form data instead, and displays a summary.
- **Instructions**:
  - **Submit the Form**: Click the "Submit" button to attempt to submit the form.
  - **Validation Checks**:
    - If the "Username" or "Password" fields are empty, an alert message will appear saying, `"Username and password are required!"`.
    - If both fields are filled in, the form data will be logged to the console, and a summary of the form data will appear in the `#output` div.
  - **Output in `#output` div**:
    - The form submission will display a message in the `#output` div showing values for `Username`, `Title`, `Selected Card Type`, and `Comments`, formatted to simulate a successful submission.
  - **Explanation**: The `submit` event listener on the form calls `event.preventDefault()` to prevent actual form submission, avoiding the 405 error. The listener validates required fields, logs the data, and displays a message in the `#output` div for demonstration purposes.

### Summary of Each Demonstration Step

1. **Field Validation Events**: Demonstrates user interactions with individual fields using `focus`, `blur`, and `change` events.
2. **Radio Button Selection Logging**: Uses `change` events to log the selected value of radio buttons in real-time.
3. **Form Submission with Validation**: Prevents actual form submission, validates required fields, and logs form data for local testing and demonstration.

By following this walkthrough, you can demonstrate each part of the form handling journey, from individual field events to form validation and logging, in a clear and logical progression. This will help users understand each concept and see how they work together in a full form-handling scenario.
